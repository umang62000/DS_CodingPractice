/*  
Ques-Given an array arr that is a permutation of [0, 1, ..., arr.length - 1], we split the array into some number
of "chunks" (partitions), and individually sort each chunk.  After concatenating them, the result equals the sorted array.
Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation:
We can split into two chunks, such as [1, 0], [2, 3, 4].
However, splitting into [1, 0], [2], [3], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.
